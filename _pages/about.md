Hello! My name is Li Liu, a 1-st year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering department at University of California, Santa Cruz. I'm fortunately co-advised by [Yuyin Zhou](https://yuyinzhou.github.io/) and [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io/). I obatined my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Zhejiang University, China. My research interest includes data analysis for healthcare, computer vision, and reliable machine learning.
